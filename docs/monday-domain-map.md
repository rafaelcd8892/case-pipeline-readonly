## Flow Details

### Entry Points

- **Appointments**: Created via Calendly integration. Each attorney has their own board (`appointments_r`, `appointments_m`, `appointments_lb`, `appointments_wh`). An appointment automatically creates a Profile.
- **Jail Intakes**: Added by staff via a form. Captures detention info, consultation scheduling. Some convert to appointments (and then profiles), some don't.

### Profile → Fee K → Work Board

A **Profile** represents a client (individual person). When hired for a service, a **Fee K** (contract) is created linking the case type and fee amount to the profile.

Each Fee K's case type determines which work board(s) get entries:

- **Court track**: EOIR hearings, trials, bond → `court_cases`
- **USCIS/NVC track**: I-forms, N-forms, DACA, TPS, consular → `_cd_open_forms`
- **Motions**: Always paired with a `court_cases` entry (motions are within someone's court case)
- **Appeals**: BIA or Circuit → `appeals`
- **FOIAs**: EOIR, G639, OBIM, FBI, NRC → `foias`
- **Litigation**: Mandamus → `litigation`
- **I-918B**: U-Visa certifications → `_lt_i918b_s`

Some case types create entries on **multiple boards** simultaneously:
- `I-485 (Adjustment in Court)` → `_cd_open_forms` + `court_cases`
- Any motion type → `motions` + `court_cases`

Court Case Rep can also be standalone (no motion).

### Direct-from-Profile Boards (no Fee K)

These boards link directly to profiles without going through a Fee K:

- **Address Changes**: Court or USCIS address updates
- **NVC Notices**: Received by mail from NVC
- **Originals+Cards+Notices**: Physical documents received (EADs, green cards, etc.)
- **RFEs**: Requests for Evidence received via email (occasionally have their own Fee K)
