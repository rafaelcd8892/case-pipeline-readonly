# Next Steps — What to Pick Up

## Current State (after Phase 5, 2026-03-06)

Phases 1 through 5 are complete. The app has:
- Client-side routing with sidebar nav (`web/router.ts`)
- 360-degree client detail with tabs (`web/components/ClientView.tsx`)
- Landing page with 6 KPI cards (incl. Alerts), clickable counts → filtered view (`web/components/LandingPage.tsx`)
- Attorney Daily Appointments page at `/appointments` (`web/components/AppointmentsPage.tsx`)
- Enhanced search: type dropdown (Clients/Contracts/Court Cases/etc.), phone/email/address partial matching
- Filtered Clients page with priority chips, status/attorney/board type dropdowns, date range (`web/components/ClientsPage.tsx`)
- Smart Alerts page at `/alerts` — overdue deadlines, stale cases, idle contracts, grouped by severity (`web/components/AlertsPage.tsx`)
- Reusable `useUrlFilters` hook for URL-driven filter persistence
- REST API at `server.ts` serving all data from read-only SQLite

332 tests passing. All code on the `read-only` branch.

## Known Bug

Runtime error on the Clients tab:
```
TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'filteredProfiles.length')
at ClientsPage2
```

## Phase 6: UI Improvements & Tab Restructure

### 6a — Expand Updates/Notes in Appointments
**Problem**: The standalone Appointments page shows "Recent Notes (N)" but only 1–2 are visible in the collapsed preview (max-height 400px).

**Solution**: Both inline expand + modal.
- Add a "Show all" toggle on the collapsible section that removes the max-height limit, showing all notes inline
- Add a "View all in modal" link that opens a full-screen modal overlay with the complete notes list, scrollable, with the same filtering and grouping as `UpdatesTimeline`

**Files**: `web/components/AppointmentsPage.tsx`, `web/components/UpdatesTimeline.tsx`, new `web/components/NotesModal.tsx`

### 6b — Additional Profile Fields
**Goal**: Show Date of Birth, Place of Birth, and A-Number alongside existing fields (name, email, phone, address, priority).

**Schema changes** (`scripts/seed/lib/db/schema.ts`):
- Add columns to `profiles`: `date_of_birth TEXT`, `place_of_birth TEXT`, `a_number TEXT`

**A-Number normalization**:
- Monday.com sends varied formats: `123456789`, `123 456 789`, `A123-456-789`, `A 123 456 789`, etc.
- Store normalized: strip non-digits, store as 9-digit string
- Display as `A###-###-###` (e.g., `A123-456-789`)
- Utility function: `normalizeANumber(raw: string): string` and `formatANumber(normalized: string): string`

**Seeder**: Generate fake DOB (age 18–80), place of birth (city + country), and 9-digit A-numbers.

**Frontend**: Update `ProfileCard.tsx` and `ClientHeaderSticky.tsx` to show new fields.

**API**: Expose new fields in profile endpoints.

### 6c — Tab Restructure (360 View)

**Current tabs**: Overview | Appointments | Documents & Notices | Relations

**New tabs**: Overview | Appointments | Contracts | Active Cases | Court Cases | Documents & Notices | Relations

**Changes**:
- **Overview**: Keep Snapshot KPI cards + Timeline only. Remove Contracts and Active Cases sections from this tab.
- **Contracts**: New tab showing all Fee K entries (pending highlighted, closed collapsed) — content currently in Overview.
- **Active Cases**: New tab showing case items from boards like Open Forms, FOIAs, Appeals, Litigation, I-918B, Motions — but **excluding** items that have an `item_relationships` link to the `court_cases` board.
- **Court Cases**: New tab showing items that ARE linked to `court_cases` board entries via `item_relationships`. Displays the connected Court Case board values (hearing dates, judge, case number, etc.). These require special attention and are separated from regular USCIS/NVC cases.
- **Documents & Notices**: Placeholder for future SharePoint integration (Phase 7). Shows a message like "SharePoint integration coming soon" with brief explanation.
- **Relations**: Unchanged.

**Files**: `web/components/ClientView.tsx`, `web/components/ClientTabs.tsx`, new `web/components/ContractsTab.tsx`, new `web/components/ActiveCasesTab.tsx`, new `web/components/CourtCasesTab.tsx`

### 6d — Appointment Focus Modal

**Goal**: Allow attorney to open a single appointment in a focused modal overlay for deep review.

**Behavior**:
- Click an appointment row (or a "Focus" button) → opens a large modal overlay
- Modal shows: full appointment details, client snapshot, all notes/updates, status controls
- Attorney can read everything without navigating away from current context
- Modal is dismissible (click outside, Escape key, close button)

**Files**: New `web/components/AppointmentModal.tsx`

**Note**: Detailed design TBD — will discuss specifics in a dedicated session.

## Phase — Live Data Mode (Dual Database)

### Goal
Use real Monday.com data for testing alongside the existing fake seeder data, without exposing sensitive client information in the repository.

### Approach: Two Databases, One Switch
- **`data/seed.db`** — fake data from the seeder (default, safe to regenerate)
- **`data/live.db`** — real Monday.com data, **gitignored**, never leaves the developer's machine
- **`DB_SOURCE=seed|live`** env var switches which database the app reads from
- Same schema, same query layer, same UI — just different data underneath

### Why This Over Anonymization
- Forces building the **sync engine** (Monday.com → SQLite), which is needed for production anyway — no throwaway work
- Zero PII risk — `live.db` is a local file, gitignored
- See *exactly* what production will look like — no anonymization artifacts
- Any developer without a Monday.com token just uses `seed` mode (the default)
- CI always runs against `seed` — no secrets needed

### What Needs to Be Built
1. **Env-based DB switching** — update `lib/db/connection.ts` (or equivalent) to read `DB_SOURCE` and resolve the path to `seed.db` or `live.db`
2. **Sync script** (`scripts/sync.ts` or similar) — fetches from Monday.com API, maps `MondayItem` → SQLite rows across all 18 boards, writes into `live.db`
3. **Gitignore `data/live.db`** (and WAL/SHM files)
4. **Document in `.env.example`** the `DB_SOURCE` and `MONDAY_API_TOKEN` vars

### Existing Building Blocks
- API client with retry/rate-limit handling: `lib/monday/api.ts`
- Board config with all 18 board IDs: `config/boards.yaml`
- Column resolver: `lib/monday/column-resolver.ts`
- Real data samples already fetched: `data/samples/*.json`
- Snapshot script as reference for fetching all boards: `scripts/snapshot.ts`

## Phase — Case Progress Map (Modular Visual Workflow)

### Goal
Give staff and attorneys an instant, visual understanding of where any client's cases stand — what's done, what's pending, and what's missing — without digging through boards.

### Core Concept: Modular Lifecycle Maps
Each case type (court case, open form, fee K, appeal, FOIA, I-918B, etc.) has its own defined lifecycle — a sequence of expected stages and artifacts. The dashboard assembles a per-client view by snapping together only the modules relevant to that client's actual cases.

**Example**: A client with a court case + an open form + a fee K sees three progress modules. A client with just a consult sees one. Each module shows its own stages independently.

### How It Works

**1. Define workflows per case type**
Each board type gets a stage map — the expected milestones in order. Examples:

- **Court Case**: NTA filed → Hearing scheduled → Evidence deadline → Brief filed → WPS filed → Application filed → Individual Hearing → Decision
- **Open Form (USCIS)**: Form assigned → Forms sent to client → Forms appointment → Filed → Receipt received → Biometrics → Interview scheduled → Interview → Decision
- **Fee K (Contract)**: Contract created → Sent to client → Signed → Payment received → Hire date set → Paralegal assigned
- **Appeal**: Notice of Appeal filed → Brief schedule received → Brief due → Brief filed → Decision
- **FOIA**: Request filed → Acknowledgment received → Results received → Follow-up

**2. Derive stage from existing data**
Each stage maps to concrete data points already in the boards:
- A column value being non-empty (e.g., `brief_filed_on` has a date → "Brief filed" is complete)
- A status column value (e.g., status = "Filed" → that stage is done)
- A file column having an attachment
- A date column being in the past vs future

No manual stage tracking needed — the map reads what's already in Monday.com/SQLite.

**3. Visual rendering**
- Horizontal progress bar or stepped pipeline per case
- Completed stages: solid/green, collapsed
- Current stage: highlighted/active
- Future stages: gray/outlined
- Missing/overdue: red flag (e.g., evidence deadline passed but no evidence filed)

**4. Assembled per profile**
The client's 360 view shows all their active case modules stacked. Completed cases collapse to a single "done" line. The attorney sees at a glance: "3 active matters, court case is at hearing stage, open form waiting on receipt, fee K fully signed."

### What Needs to Be Built
1. **Workflow definitions** — YAML or TypeScript config defining stages per board type, with the column/condition that marks each stage complete
2. **Stage resolver** — function that takes a board item's column values and returns which stages are complete/pending/overdue
3. **CaseProgressMap component** — React component rendering the visual pipeline for one case
4. **ProfileProgressView component** — assembles all CaseProgressMap modules for a client
5. **Integration** — new tab or section in ClientView (possibly the Overview tab)

### Why This Matters
This is the feature that turns the dashboard from a "data viewer" into a "case management tool." Staff stops asking "what's the status?" — they see it. Attorneys stop forgetting deadlines — they're red on the map. New staff understands a case in seconds instead of clicking through 5 boards.

## Deferred — Monday.com Write-Back

The appointments page is the first feature that will need editing (update status, add notes, reschedule). `TODO(monday-write)` markers are placed in the query layer and component. See `docs/decisions.md` for the planned write-back architecture.

## Phase 7: SharePoint Document Integration

### Goal
View client e-files and consult files from SharePoint directly in the dashboard, without switching apps.

### Background
- Every client has an **e-file** in SharePoint: `/{Letter}/{LASTNAME, Firstname CaseNumber}/` with subfolders (FEE Ks, CC, FILINGS, COURT FILINGS, etc.)
- Every consultee has a **consult file**: `/{Year}/{LASTNAME, Firstname}/`
- Mutually exclusive — when hired, consult file moves to e-files
- Monday.com already stores the direct SharePoint folder URL per client (two columns: e-file link, consult file link)
- Azure AD app exists with `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `Sites.Read.All`, `User.Read`

### Phase 7a — Read-Only Browsing

**Schema**:
- Add `sharepoint_url` column to `profiles` table (stores the Monday.com link value)
- Seeder generates placeholder URLs for local dev

**Backend**:
- `GET /api/profiles/:id/documents` — takes stored SharePoint URL, calls Graph API to list folder contents
- Auth via client_credentials flow (tenant ID, client ID, client secret in `.env`)
- Cache folder listings ~5 min
- Graph API call: `/sites/{site-id}/drives/{drive-id}/root:/{path}:/children`

**Frontend**:
- "Documents" tab on ClientView showing file/folder tree
- Badge indicating "E-File" or "Consult File"
- Click file → opens in SharePoint browser
- Click folder → expands inline

### Phase 7b — Embedded Previews

- PDFs/images render inline in the dashboard
- Office docs use SharePoint's embed preview URL (Graph API provides `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` and preview endpoints)

### Phase 7c — Upload

- Upload from dashboard into the correct SharePoint subfolder
- Uses existing `Files.ReadWrite.All` permission

### Blockers Before Starting
- **SharePoint site URL** — e.g. `yourorg.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteName` (needed to construct Graph API paths)
- **Monday.com column names** — which columns hold the e-file and consult file links
- **Azure AD credentials** — tenant ID, client ID, client secret (to be added to `.env`)
