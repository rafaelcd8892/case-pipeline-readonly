# Case Pipeline

A config-driven read-only analysis and document generation platform for Monday.com, connected to a production immigration law workspace with 18 tracked boards.

> **Branch: `read-only`** - All Monday.com write operations have been removed. This branch is safe to run against production data.

---

## Features

- **Client Dashboard** - Web-based 360-degree view of any client: profile, contracts, active cases, pending items, appointments, and full updates/notes timeline
- **Updates Timeline** - Centralized feed of all Monday.com updates, replies, and automation emails across every board — grouped by date with threaded replies
- **Query Layer** - Typed functions for client search (FTS5), contracts, board items, updates, and full case summaries
- **JSON API** - RESTful endpoints served by `Bun.serve()` for the dashboard and future integrations
- **Real Profile Fixtures** - Handpicked real Monday.com profiles (Ashik, Jabez, Karen, Fernando) seeded alongside generated data for realistic testing
- **Document Generation** - Create documents from Monday.com data using Handlebars templates with interactive profile selection
- **Test Data Seeding** - Generate realistic test data locally with Faker.js and SQLite (no Monday.com sync)
- **Configuration Sync** - Keep board configurations in sync with Monday.com using YAML-based definitions
- **Relationship Analysis** - Visualize board connections, mirror columns, and data flow with phantom board filtering

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime (v1.0+)
- Monday.com API token

### Installation

```bash
bun install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your Monday.com credentials:

```env
MONDAY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

Board configurations are defined in `config/boards.yaml`.

## CLI Usage

The unified CLI provides access to all functionality:

```bash
bun cli.ts <command> [options]
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `render` | Generate documents from Monday.com items |
| `seed` | Generate realistic test data locally (SQLite) |
| `lookup` | Search clients and view 360 case summary |
| `sync` | Synchronize board configuration with Monday.com |
| `analyze` | Analyze board relationships and generate maps |

### Examples

```bash
# Interactive document generation - browse and select a profile
bun cli.ts render

# Render a specific item
bun cli.ts render --item=123456789

# Generate 10 test profiles with 2-3 contracts each
bun cli.ts seed --profiles=10 --contracts=2-3

# Search for a client by name
bun cli.ts lookup Garcia

# View full 360 case summary by ID
bun cli.ts lookup --id=<local_id>

# Start the web dashboard
bun run dev

# Sync board configuration
bun cli.ts sync

# Discover all boards in workspace
bun cli.ts sync --discover

# Generate relationship map as markdown
bun cli.ts analyze -o=docs/boards.md

# Generate map showing only tracked board connections
bun cli.ts analyze --tracked-only --main-board=profiles -o=docs/boards.md

# Export relationship data as JSON
bun cli.ts analyze --format=json -o=map.json
```

Run `bun cli.ts <command> --help` for detailed options.

## Architecture

### Config-Driven Design

Board definitions live in `config/boards.yaml`, making it easy to:
- Add new boards without code changes
- Define column mappings with fallback strategies
- Configure relationships between boards

### Column Resolution

Columns are resolved using flexible strategies:
- `by_type` - Match by Monday.com column type
- `by_title` - Match by column title (case-insensitive)
- `by_id` - Match by exact column ID

Strategies can be chained for fallback behavior.

## Design

The dashboard uses a **warm editorial** aesthetic: Fraunces serif for display headings, Outfit sans-serif for body text, and a deep navy + amber accent palette. Updates are shown with author initials (deterministic colors), date-grouped sections, and threaded reply indentation.
